🔍 Detailed Explanation
✅ 1. MySQL
Type: Relational DBMS

Use Cases: CMS (WordPress), eCommerce (Magento), medium-scale apps

Strengths:

Easy to use

Strong community support

Compatible with many web tools

Limitations:

Slower for massive JOINs

Some advanced features only in Enterprise edition

Best For:

Traditional apps needing stable RDBMS

✅ 2. MariaDB
Type: Fork of MySQL (open source)

Use Cases: Same as MySQL, with better performance on some workloads

Strengths:

100% open source

Faster replication, more storage engines (Aria, ColumnStore)

MySQL compatible APIs

Limitations:

Still catching up in enterprise support

Best For:

MySQL users wanting full open-source control and better performance

✅ 3. PostgreSQL
Type: Relational DBMS (object-relational)

Use Cases: Financial systems, BI, data warehouses, GIS

Strengths:

Most ACID-compliant

Complex queries, full JOINs, window functions

Built-in JSON/JSONB support

Extensions like PostGIS, TimescaleDB

Limitations:

Slightly steeper learning curve

Best For:

Data-heavy applications, analytics, compliance-heavy workloads

✅ 4. MongoDB
Type: NoSQL (document store)

Use Cases: Real-time apps, IoT, CMS, event logs

Strengths:

Schema-less: insert documents without defining schema

Fast writes and flexible queries

Built-in horizontal scaling (sharding)

Limitations:

Joins are possible but slower (via $lookup)

Weak strictness (optional schema)

Best For:

Projects with flexible data, rapid development needs, unstructured data

💡 When to Use What?
Situation	Best DB	Why?
Traditional apps (CMS, eCommerce)	MySQL / MariaDB	Easy to use, reliable
Open-source only, high write speed	MariaDB	Fast, open, MySQL-compatible
Complex queries, analytics, compliance-heavy	PostgreSQL	Full SQL, ACID, extensions
Dynamic schema, JSON, real-time inserts	MongoDB	Schema-less, fast write, document store
IoT, logs, real-time tracking	MongoDB	High ingest rate, flexible schema
Enterprise-grade, 100% open-source RDBMS	PostgreSQL	Powerful, strict, scalable

🧪 Benchmark Summary (Rough)
Test Type	MySQL	MariaDB	PostgreSQL	MongoDB
🔹 Insert 1M rows	Fast	Faster	Moderate	Fastest
🔹 Complex JOINs	Medium	Medium	Best	Weak
🔹 JSON data	Poor	Poor	Excellent	Native
🔹 Transactions	Good	Good	Best	Basic
🔹 Full Text Search	Moderate	Better	Excellent	Good

Great question! Here's a practical and honest comparison of Node.js vs PHP, depending on what you're building — not just raw performance.

✅ Quick Verdict (TL;DR)
Goal / Use Case	Best Choice	Why?
REST API or microservices	✅ Node.js	Faster, non-blocking I/O, modern tooling
Full-stack JavaScript (frontend+backend)	✅ Node.js	JS everywhere, better integration
Traditional web apps (CMS, eCommerce)	✅ PHP	WordPress, Laravel, faster to scaffold
Real-time apps (chat, IoT, sockets)	✅ Node.js	Built-in async, WebSocket-native
Simpler web forms, legacy systems	✅ PHP	Easy deployment, shared hosting support
Performance under high concurrency	✅ Node.js	Event-driven, handles many connections
Rapid prototyping or static sites	✅ PHP	Easy to deploy quickly

🧠 Key Differences
Feature	Node.js	PHP
🌐 Language	JavaScript (runs in V8 engine)	PHP
🔁 Concurrency	Non-blocking, event-driven	Blocking (multi-threaded)
🚀 Performance	High (good for real-time and APIs)	Decent (better in PHP 8+)
🛠️ Tooling	npm (huge ecosystem)	Composer (smaller ecosystem)
🧱 Frameworks	Express, NestJS, Fastify	Laravel, Symfony, CodeIgniter
📦 Package Manager	npm/yarn	Composer
🗄️ Hosting	Node server or cloud (VPS, Docker)	Works on any shared host, LAMP stack
📊 Popularity	Modern web apps, scalable platforms	Legacy systems, small-medium websites
🧪 Testing Tools	Jest, Mocha, Supertest	PHPUnit
🔧 Maintainability	Clean with modern tools (TypeScript)	Cleaner with Laravel

🧪 Performance: Insert & Select 1 Million Records
Operation	Node.js (MySQL/PostgreSQL)	PHP (MySQL/PostgreSQL)
Insert Speed	🚀 Fast (async batching)	⚙️ Slower (sequential)
Select Speed	🟢 Fast	🟢 Fast
Memory Use	Moderate	Lower
CPU Use	Efficient for many users	Slower under high load

Conclusion: Node.js scales better for concurrent users and high-throughput tasks like STB management or IoT.

🧰 Best Fit Scenarios
Scenario	Choose
Remote device control / STB system	✅ Node.js
Real-time status & dashboard	✅ Node.js
Admin panel with quick setup	✅ PHP
Long-term scalable API	✅ Node.js
Static CMS / blog	✅ PHP

💡 Recommendation for You
Since you've asked about:

STB remote management

MQTT integration

PostgreSQL/MongoDB testing

REST APIs and 1M record load tests

👉 Node.js is the better choice for your current use case due to:

Non-blocking architecture

MQTT & WebSocket native support

Better async DB handling

Unified JavaScript code across stack
